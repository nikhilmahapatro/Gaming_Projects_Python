# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game – Python Turtle Graphics

A colorful and fun racing simulation game built using **Python’s Turtle Graphics module**. Choose your turtle and watch the race unfold in real-time with a touch of randomness and suspense!

This game is great for beginners learning graphical programming, loops, and randomness in Python.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The program opens a Turtle Graphics window with multiple colored turtles at the starting line.
- You (the player) choose which color turtle you think will win.
- All turtles move forward with **random speeds** until one crosses the finish line.
- If your chosen turtle wins — you win! 🎉

## 🛠️ Features

- 🐢 Multiple turtles with distinct colors
- 🎨 Visually interactive GUI using `turtle` module
- 🧠 Randomized race behavior for unpredictability
- ✅ Input validation for user guesses
- 🏁 Finish line logic and winner announcement
