# TurtleRacing

This repository contains a simple Python game built using the `turtle` graphics module. It simulates a race between multiple turtles of different colors, where the user guesses which one will win. The game is interactive, visual, and introduces randomness to simulate a fun racing experience.

In this project, we:

- Use Python’s built-in `turtle` module to create a simple graphical interface
- Create and animate multiple turtle racers on screen
- Take user input to guess the winning turtle before the race begins
- Randomize turtle movement to determine the race outcome
- Display a message based on whether the user’s guess was correct

This repo is ideal for those learning how to:

- Use Python’s `turtle` module for basic graphics programming
- Work with loops and event-driven animation
- Handle user input in graphical applications
- Add visual interactivity to beginner Python projects
