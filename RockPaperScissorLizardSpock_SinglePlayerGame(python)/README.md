# RockPaperScissorLizardSpock

This repository contains a terminal-based Python game based on the extended Rock-Paper-Scissors format, including Lizard and Spock. Inspired by The Big Bang Theory, this project serves as a fun way to apply core Python concepts while building a simple, interactive command-line game.

In this project, we:

- Implement the full logic of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock using conditional rules
- Use Python’s `random` module to simulate the computer’s move
- Validate user input to ensure a smooth game experience
- Track outcomes across multiple rounds of gameplay
- Present results clearly in a terminal-based interface

This repo is ideal for those learning how to:

- Work with conditional logic and branching in Python
- Build basic interactive applications in the terminal
- Use randomness and user input effectively
- Develop logic-heavy games with multiple winning combinations
