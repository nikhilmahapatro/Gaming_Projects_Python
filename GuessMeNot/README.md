# 🎯 Guess Me Not – Python Number Guessing Game (With a Twist)

**Guess Me Not** is a clever take on the classic number guessing game — with a twist! Instead of just guessing the computer's number, you're up against **mind tricks and logic**. It's a fun, terminal-based game built in Python for beginners to learn control flow, randomness, and user interaction.

## 🕹️ Game Objective

- The computer picks a **random number**.
- You try to guess it — but beware: the computer may **mislead you** with its hints!
- Each round reveals how close (or far) you are, but the feedback isn't always straightforward.

> Think you're good at guessing? Try when the game starts playing **mind games** back!
