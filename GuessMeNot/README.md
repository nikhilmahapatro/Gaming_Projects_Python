# GuessMeNot

This repository features a twist on the classic number guessing game, written in Python for the terminal. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly selected number, while occasionally offering misleading hints to increase the difficulty and fun.

In this project, we:

- Generate a random target number using Pythonâ€™s `random` module
- Continuously prompt the user to guess the number until correct
- Introduce occasional false hints to mislead or challenge the player
- Track the number of attempts and display results after completion
- Ensure valid input and smooth command-line interaction

This repo is ideal for those learning how to:

- Work with loops, conditionals, and randomization in Python
- Build interactive text-based games in the terminal
- Handle user input and basic input validation
- Apply creative logic to enhance traditional programming exercises
